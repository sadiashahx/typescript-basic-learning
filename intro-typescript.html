    Typescript -> enhanced version of javascript, building on javascript, not a new language this is just add some new features in js

    But TS can not run directly on the browser, then TS compiler convert the code from typescript to javascript.

    Developed by microsoft, 2012, influenced by javascript.

    Typescript Benefit:

    1. Check error on compile time
    2. Add type like string, number, bool etc
    3. We can add Object Oriented way with TS 
    4. Code is well managed

    Why Typescript:

    Issue:

    function add(num1, num2) {
        return num1 + num2;       // pass number must
    }

    add('2', '5');                // but pass string
